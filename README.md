# Jetfire---Airlines-based-NER-using-NLP

Nowadays automation is the frontier of every business and IT industries. Artificial Intelligence/ NLP/ Machine Learning have invaded almost all sectors. 
In our case , Airlines industry is smoothly working on NLP , for conversational purpose. You go to any  airlines/ aviation website there will be a chat-bot ready to assist you 24*7 with your queries. However , our project requirement is a little erratic from the above one. 
While booking a ticket, PNR is generated for each Fare basis and attached to it are the Fare rules generally defined by the GDS (Global Distribution System) or Airlines itself. Our objective is too automate the task of Technical Support guy sitting in back-end and manually initiating the Refund/ Cancellation procedure. If we can make our model to learn the fare Rules from the Corpus generated , we can think about automating the refund.  
However there are pros and cons of this test case, but we are running POC for the sake of our satisfaction , that whether Airlines industry is vulnerable to automate the refund with help of NLP or not.
